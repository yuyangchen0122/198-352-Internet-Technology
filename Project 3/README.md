1- if you are working as a group only one member should submit the project and write the other member's name in project description.

2- client and AS server should run in the same computer, TLDS1 should run in cpp.cs.rutgers.edu and TLDS2 should run in java.cs.rutgers.edu. The client and AS server should not run in the same computer as TLDS1 and TLDS2 (e.g., do not use cpp.cs.rutgers.edu and  java.cs.rutgers.edu for them).

3- Please do not take any input from the user, hard code port numbers yourself and for IP address you should be able to find the proper IP addresses within the program. Taking input from users make grading tedious and may result to reduction of the points.

4- it is better to use the default python of the ilab servers which is python 2.

5- if there is a NS entry in the test files ignore them.
